ODE Solver
You must implement an ODE integrator/evolver by hand. You should implement both 
Euler's method and 4th order Runge-kutta (you do not need to derive the weights). 
You must also compare to one provided by the Scipy library. 
2 Options: Euler's method or 4th order Runge-kutta
Always do the scipy one and show comparison
