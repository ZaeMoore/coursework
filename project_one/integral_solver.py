Integral Solver
you must implement an integrator using the simple riemann sum, the trapezoidal rule, 
and simpson's rule. In the case of the trapezoidal and simpson's rule, compare to 
the similar implementations in Scipy. 
3 options: Riemann, trapezoidal, simpson's
if t or s, compare to scipy's implementations
