Welcome to the interactive neutrino simulation experience!
~A neutrino's best quality is its wiggles~

Simply download this package and install it to begin!

Enter the directory mcs_neutrino_package and install the dependencies with "pip install ."

Then, enter src/neutrino_simulation

"python mcs_project_main.py" to run

Enter the requested information in the command line! This will be passed to the simulation.

The simulation will output a .csv file with information on the flavor of the neutrino, whether it oscillated,
the type of interaction that occurred, the final state particles, and the energy of the neutrino.
