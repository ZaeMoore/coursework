Welcome to the interactive neutrino simulation experience!
~A neutrino's best quality is its wiggles~

Simply download this package and install it to begin!

Typing "run-nu" into the command line will run the main script.

Enter the requested information in the command line! This will be passed to the simulation.

The simulation will output a .csv file with information on the flavor of the neutrino, whether it oscillated,
the type of interaction that occurred, the final state particles, and the energy of the neutrino.
